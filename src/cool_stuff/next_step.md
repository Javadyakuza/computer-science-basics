# Next Step, ADHD Controller

The next step project is a minimal web project that targets the concentrate problem of the people who have the `ADHD` super power.

## What Does it do ? 


The Next Stop project has a single purpose, it  keep your attention into a goal that you defined before get into your work.

It follows three simple rules:
    - One Step at the time
    - One step at the mind
    - Many steps at the End

These rules result is you end up doing what you said earlier.

## Pros and Cons of ADHD

Cons

    - Thinking a lot
    - Planing a lot
    - Not operating at all
    - Lack of Concentration
    - Leaving the works undone

Pros
    
    - They operate incredibly fast and efficient at the emergent
    - If they concentrate they operate 1000 times better than the normal people


> So why don't we  stop fighting against the Cons of our ADHD and try to concentrate on our pros and leverage them ?   


## Solution

We use a three step solution:
    
- Generally Plan
- Recognize the `Next Step`
- Don't think about anything, Just do the `Next Step`

### They only key to win is to `SLAP` yourself !

When ever you were getting distracted just imagine that you are being slapped by someone that is your boss, he is just slapping you and yelling at you get back to work.
